This is a bot built on ideas from people who can't code - and maintained by [Mee42](https://github.com/Mee42)


Contributing is very easy - install git, make some edits, and make a pull request. Contact me for any questions regarding how to use git/github

Code contributions can be made even without any java code - find more information [here](https://github.com/Mee42/community-bot/wiki)
